### Hey! ðŸ˜„

I'm a Software Engineer from the United Kingdom with a Computer Science BSc (Hons) and a Bioinformatics MSc and can usually be found working on my Discord bot [Ser Aymeric](https://seraymeric.com), which is currently providing utility and fun features to over 24,000 servers. I also run one of Discord's partnered LGBTQ communities.

Much of my experience is with ASP.NET MVC and C#, but I took a liking to Python after having to use it for my masters degree to analyse and interpret biological data using statistical tools such as machine learning, though I used R for much of that work too. I have since made use of Python in projects involving RESTful APIs, image generation, data visualisation and various integrations with Discord with a heavy preference for Python's asynchronous capabilities.

More recently I have been working with Next.js as I wanted to learn React, yet still be able to leverage the advantages of static generation for my web projects and I aim to have something tangible to show off soon, with a bit of Electron.js thrown in too, for fun.

As for database technologies, I can't say I don't miss my joins between normalised data tables, but I'm a NoSQL fan right now. I do wish you could bit shift in MongoDB's aggregation pipeline, though. That's a gripe of mine, right now!

Thank you for reading and feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yandawl), or in my [Discord](http://discord.gg/38GdPqK) should you feel any desire to.
