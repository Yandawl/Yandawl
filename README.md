### Hi there ðŸ˜„

I'm a Software Engineer with Computer Science BSc (Hons) and a Bioinformatics MSc. I mainly work with C# & ASP.NET MVC though most of my hobby and academic projects make use of Python and R.

I can usually be found working on my Discord bot, [Ser Aymeric](https://seraymeric.com), which is currently serving around 20,000 Discord servers. In this project I seek to improve my knowledge of both Python and MongoDB.

If you'd like to contact me you can do so in my [Discord](http://discord.gg/38GdPqK), my username is Lethys#0001.

Thanks for reading!
